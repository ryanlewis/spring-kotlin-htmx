# Spring Boot + kotlinx.html + htmx demo

A very simple demo, showing how [kotlinx.html](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html)
and [htmx](https://htmx.org/) can be used with Spring Boot.

- As kotlinx.html is all native Kotlin, no template engines are needed
- As htmx is all HTML, no JavaScript is needed

## Running

```bash
# Linux / macOS
./gradlew bootRun

# Windows
gradlew.bat bootRun
```

Otherwise, import it into your favourite IDE and play with it there.
